# COVID19_Seir_Model
A Seir model to predict the evolution of a COVID19 outbreak. The code description is in spanish as is made for Cuba so far.

The data and parameters are set to match the conditions of the outbreak in Cuba. More refining is needed and the posibility to input parameters is still missing.

This model is still in development and is not intended to accurate cientific predictions, use at your own risk.
